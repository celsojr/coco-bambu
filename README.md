# Coco Bambu Restaurant

A fullstack project developed in MEAN Stack (MongoDB - Express - Angular - NodeJS) + Docker.

## How to run this project

Requirements to run the project in a development environment quickly:

1. Git
1. Docker
1. Docker Compose

```sh
git clone https://github.com/celsojr/coco-bambu.git

cd coco-bambu

docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.debug.yml up -d --build
```

The first run may take a little longer, but subsequent runs will be faster. After that just browse to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and type in the test user credentials like shown:

- Usu√°rio: `testeusername`
- Senha: `testesenha`

It is also possible to register new users at [http://localhost:4200/register](http://localhost:4200/register) provisionally.

Example of direct API call via `curl`:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" http://localhost:3000/api/receitas | jq
```

MongoDB database connection string example

```sh
# Database connection string
mongodb+svr://admin-user:admin-password@localhost:27017
```

Example of a call now using **MongoDB Playground** via **VS Code extension**:

```javascript
/** MongoDB Playground **/

// Database in question / context
use("coco-bambu");

// Search for a specific document via id
db.getCollection("receitas").find({ _id: "609c1a6c1b14d85c97fb107e" });
```

## Cleaning the development environment

Freeing up resources after use (procedure not recommended in production)

```sh
# Docker frees containers, networks and volumes with this command
# Also, it has a combined command to remove files generated by MongoDB
# (system admin user password required)
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.debug.yml down -v && sudo rm -rf ./mongo/db

# Delete unused (untagged) docker images after builds
docker image prune
```
